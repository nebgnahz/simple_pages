Welcome to my website. I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in `Your Research Area`
at `Your School`. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

My research focuses on `Your Research Area`. It is a long established fact that
a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various
versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
purpose (injected humour and the like).

# Research

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

# [](#header-1)Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform
for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on
projects from anywhere.

## [](#header-2)Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### [](#header-3)Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
